# EkaRise — Login Page

This is my **first project in my full-stack learning journey**.

Currently, I am working on the **frontend part**, and this repository contains the **login page UI** built using **HTML and CSS**.

## Current Work

- Login page UI completed  
- Frontend structure created using HTML  
- Styling and layout done using CSS 

## Learning Focus

Through this project, I am focusing on:

- HTML structure and nesting  
- CSS fundamentals  
- Layout using Flexbox  
- Transitions, transforms, and animations  
- Shadow, glow effects, and basic UI styling  

## Next Steps

- Make the login page **responsive**  
- Use **CSS Grid (box grid)**  
- After that, start building the **dashboard UI**  
- Then move forward with frontend JavaScript and backend learning  

## Note

This project is made only for **learning purposes**.  
Right now, the focus is on **concept clarity and practice**, not on making everything perfect.
